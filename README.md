This real esate implementation is an ERC721 token that allows you to buy and sell houses on the OpenSea market place. It uses a zero-knowledge proof implemented via ZoKrates to enable only users with the proof to mint houses. 

You can view the contract on the OpenSea testnet marketplace, https://testnets.opensea.io/collection/unidentified-contract-xwsemf4aro, I purchased a few houses via another address on https://testnets.opensea.io/Jack_McCabe.
